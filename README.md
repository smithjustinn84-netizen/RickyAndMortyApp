## Welcome to the Human Systems Android Interview Process

The goal of this interview is to see how you approach a problem and how you structure your code.  You should be able to thoroughly explain your thought process and the decisions you make.  We are not looking for a perfect solution, but we are looking for a solution that is well-thought-out and easy to understand.  When writing code, please be sure to keep in mind how we will scale the application in the future.  We want to see that you can write code that is maintainable and extensible.

Once you have completed the project, please share the resulting project with us.  In the interview, we will go through the code and discuss your decisions.  There is the possibility that we will ask you to make some changes to the code during the interview or add a new feature.
